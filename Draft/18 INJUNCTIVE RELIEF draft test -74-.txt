Plaintiff realleges paragraphs 1 through ____ above as though fully set forth herein.

This is an action for preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against Defendant.

Moreover, Sculpture has either already, or has indicated that it will soon be completely severing Plaintiffs’ ability to fulfill its customer orders by removing Plaintiffs from the auditing software and diverting customers in Plaintiffs’ territories to other new or existing franchisees.

The threatened injury to Plaintiffs clearly outweigh any harm that may befall on Sculpture by reason of the injunction, which simply maintains the status quo, and also outweighs any harm attributable to Kaplan, Pineiro, and Ortega. 

Such injunctive relief is consonant with and will not harm the public interest.

Defendant’s actions constitute (i) material violations of Defendant’s contractual obligations; (ii) breaches of Defendant’s common-law and statutory fiduciary duties owed to Plaintiff; and (iii) serious tortious misconduct against the interests of the Plaintiff.

Absent injunctive relief, Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm and permanent impairment of the economic value of their valuable franchise rights and will suffer continuing damages including loss of goodwill, loss of profits and the permanent and complete destruction of their businesses. These harms are not readily measurable or fully compensable in monetary damages. Thus, Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law.

Accordingly, preliminary and final injunctive relief is warranted to maintain the status quo and to prevent irreparable harm to Plaintiffs pending a full hearing on the merits of Plaintiff’s request for declaratory relief.
