In addition to Defendant’s wrongful competition with Plaintiff’s business and the usurpation of the Plaintiff’s business opportunities, Defendant misappropriated the Plaintiff’s bank account funds.

On May 10, 2016, Defendant made an improper and unauthorized withdrawal from Plaintiff’s bank account (account ending with 9601) in the amount of $5,318.00.  

There is, and remains, no authorized or acceptable business purpose for the May 10, 2016 withdrawal by Defendant.

On information and belief, Defendant caused such funds to be placed in the hands of a third-party who is not affiliated with Plaintiff’s business.

Pursuant to Section 6.08 of the Operating Agreement, Defendant was expressly forbidden from “permit[ting] the Company’s funds to be commingled with the funds of any other person” and was also prohibited from “possess[ing] property or assign rights in specific property for other than a Company purpose.”  See Operating Agreement at Section 6.08.

In addition to violating the Operating Agreement, Defendant’s misappropriation of Plaintiff’s funds represents a very serious tortious act against Plaintiff.
