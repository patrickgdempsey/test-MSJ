Moreover, Sculpture has either already, or has indicated that it will soon be completely severing Plaintiffs’ ability to fulfill its customer orders by removing Plaintiffs from the auditing software and diverting customers in Plaintiffs’ territories to other new or existing franchisees.

Such injunctive relief is consonant with and will not harm the public interest.

The threatened injury to Plaintiffs clearly outweigh any harm that may befall on Sculpture by reason of the injunction.  The injunction simply maintains the status quo, and also outweighs any harm attributable to Kaplan, Pineiro, and Ortega. 

Defendant’s actions constitute (i) violations of Defendant’s contractual obligations and fundamental obligations; (ii) breaches of Defendant’s common-law and statutory fiduciary duties owed to Plaintiff; and (iii) serious tortious misconduct against the interests of the Plaintiff.

Absent injunctive relief, Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm. These harms are not readily measurable or fully compensable in monetary damages. Thus, Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law.  These will include special damages.

Accordingly, preliminary and final injunctive relief is warranted to maintain the status quo and to prevent irreparable harm to Plaintiffs pending a full hearing on the merits of Plaintiff’s request for declaratory relief.

And this is another remote update.

And this is a scrivener update.
